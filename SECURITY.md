# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The **Validators** project follows a rolling-release model.  
Only the latest `main` branch is actively maintained for bug and security fixes.

| Version | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| main     | ✅                 |
| < main   | ❌                 |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue or suspect a potential vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public issue.**  
   Please report it privately via email at **security@y-consulting.us** or through **GitHub Security Advisories**.

2. Include the following information:
   - A clear description of the issue  
   - Steps to reproduce, if applicable  
   - Impact or potential exploit scenario  
   - Suggested mitigation or fix (optional)

3. You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours**.  
   Once verified, we will:
   - Reproduce and confirm the issue  
   - Work on a fix in a private branch  
   - Credit responsible disclosure in release notes (unless anonymity requested)

## Disclosure Policy

- Coordinated disclosure preferred.  
- Fixes are released publicly once validated and merged into `main`.  
- Proof-of-concept or exploit details are not published until a patch is available.

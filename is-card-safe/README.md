# is-card-safe

**Lightweight, dependency-free credit card validator and brand detector.**  
Performs Luhn checksum, detects brand (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.), and normalizes safely.  
No dependencies. No runtime risk.

---

## üöÄ Why
Most credit card libraries are heavy, outdated, or expose data risk.  
`is-card-safe` is a single auditable file that performs format and checksum validation without sending or logging card numbers.

---

## üì¶ Usage
```js
import { validateCard } from './is-card-safe/card.js';

validateCard('4111 1111 1111 1111');
// ‚Üí { ok: true, normalized: '4111111111111111', brand: 'visa', last4: '1111', issues: [] }

validateCard('5555 5555 5555 4444');
// ‚Üí { ok: true, normalized: '5555555555554444', brand: 'mastercard', last4: '4444', issues: [] }

validateCard('1234 5678 9012 3456');
// ‚Üí { ok: false, brand: 'unknown', issues: ['luhn_failed', 'unknown_brand'] }
```

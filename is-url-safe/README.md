# is-url-safe

Strict, dependency-free HTTP(S) URL validator for browser and Node.

## Overview

`is-url-safe` rejects non-HTTP schemes like `javascript:`, `data:`, and `mailto:`.
It performs structural validation using the built-in `URL` constructor, then enforces
a restricted protocol and a clean ASCII hostname.

This helper is designed for client-side form validation, link sanitization, and
lightweight content moderation.

## Features

- ‚úÖ Only `http` and `https` schemes allowed
- üö´ Blocks `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `ftp:`, and similar schemes
- ‚úÖ Verifies hostname presence and rejects invalid characters (`<`, `>`, space)
- ‚úÖ Browser and Node.js compatible
- ‚úÖ No dependencies
- ü™∂ <1 KB

## Usage

```js
import { isUrlSafe, normalizeUrl } from './url.js';

isUrlSafe('https://example.com');         // true
isUrlSafe('javascript:alert(1)');         // false
isUrlSafe('ftp://server.com');            // false
isUrlSafe('https://good.com/<bad>');      // false

normalizeUrl('https://example.com/path?q=1');
// -> 'https://example.com/path?q=1'
```

## API

### `isUrlSafe(raw: string): boolean`

Returns `true` only if the given string is a valid `http(s)` URL with a
non-empty hostname and without control characters.

### `normalizeUrl(raw: string): string`

Returns a normalized absolute URL (protocol, hostname, path, query, hash).
Returns an empty string if invalid.

## Example (test.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<script type="module">
import { isUrlSafe } from './url.js';

const urls = [
  'https://example.com',
  'http://sub.domain.org/path?x=1',
  'ftp://server.com',
  'javascript:alert(1)',
  'data:text/plain,hi',
  'https://good.com/<bad>'
];

for (const u of urls) {
  console.log(u, '=>', isUrlSafe(u));
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

**Strict, dependency-free HTTP(S) URL validator and normalizer.**  
Lightweight, auditable, and safe to use in browsers, Node.js, or edge runtimes.

---

## üöÄ Why

Most URL validators are too permissive or allow unsafe schemes like `javascript:` or `data:`.  
`is-url-safe` enforces strict `http(s)`-only rules with zero dependencies and predictable behavior.

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Only allows `http` and `https` protocols  
- üö´ Blocks `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `ftp:` and similar schemes  
- ‚úÖ Rejects invalid hostnames and disallowed characters (`<`, `>`, space)  
- ‚úÖ Compatible with browsers, Node.js, and edge environments  
- ‚úÖ Zero dependencies ‚Äî pure ES module  

## üì¶ Usage

```js
import { isUrlSafe, normalizeUrl } from './url.js';

isUrlSafe('https://example.com');        // true
isUrlSafe('javascript:alert(1)');        // false
normalizeUrl(' https://example.com/path?q=1 ');
// ‚Üí "https://example.com/path?q=1"
```

---

## üß© Validation rules

- Must start with `http` or `https`  
- Hostname must be present and contain only valid ASCII characters  
- No spaces or control characters allowed  
- Optional path, query, and hash supported  

---

## üß† API

### `isUrlSafe(raw: string): boolean`

Returns `true` only if the given string is a valid HTTP(S) URL with a non-empty hostname and without control characters.

### `normalizeUrl(raw: string): string`

Returns a normalized absolute URL including protocol, hostname, path, query, and hash.  
Returns an empty string if invalid.

**Tiny, dependency-free E.164 phone validator and normalizer.**  
Lightweight, auditable, and safe to embed directly in web or backend code.

---

## üöÄ Why

Most phone validation libraries are heavy or depend on outdated regex sets.  
`phone-e164` is a single file ‚Äî zero dependencies, zero runtime risk.

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Validates and normalizes international phone numbers in E.164 format  
- ‚úÖ Removes spaces, dashes, parentheses, and other common formatting  
- ‚úÖ Detects invalid or incomplete country codes  
- ‚úÖ Works in browsers, Node.js, and edge runtimes  
- ‚úÖ Zero dependencies ‚Äî pure ES module  

## üì¶ Usage

```bash
normalizePhone(' (415) 555-0123 '); // "+4155550123"
isE164('+4155550123'); // true
validatePhone('415-555-0123'); // true (normalizes to +4155550123)
```

## üß© Validation rules

- Total length ‚â§ 254  
- Local part ‚â§ 64  
- ASCII-only (no UTF-8 emoji or accents)  
- No consecutive dots or leading/trailing dots  
- Domain has ‚â• 2 labels  
- TLD = letters only, 2‚Äì63 chars  

## API

### `isE164(raw: string): boolean`

Returns true only if the given string is a valid E.164 phone number, starting with + and containing only digits.

### `normalizePhone(raw: string): string`

Returns a cleaned and normalized E.164-like string (e.g. +14155550123).
Removes spaces, parentheses, dots, and dashes.

### `validatePhone(raw: string): boolean`

Accepts loose input (with or without +) and attempts normalization before validating.
Returns true only if the normalized result passes isE164.

## Example (test.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { normalizePhone, isE164, validatePhone } from './phone.js';

      const numbers = [
        '(415) 555-0123',
        '+1 415 555 0123',
        '00441555550123',
        '14155550123',
        'abc+4155550123',
        '+9999999999999999'
      ];

      for (const n of numbers) {
        console.log(n, '‚Üí', {
          normalized: normalizePhone(n),
          valid: validatePhone(n),
          strict: isE164(n)
        });
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>

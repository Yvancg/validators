# is-phone-e164

**Tiny, dependency-free E.164 phone validator and normalizer.**  
Lightweight, auditable, and safe to embed directly in web or backend code.

---

## 🚀 Why
Most phone validation libraries are heavy or depend on outdated regex sets.  
`phone-e164` is a single file — zero dependencies, zero runtime risk.

## 🌟 Features
- ✅ Validates and normalizes international phone numbers in E.164 format  
- ✅ Removes spaces, dashes, parentheses, and other common formatting  
- ✅ Detects invalid or incomplete country codes  
- ✅ Works in browsers, Node.js, and edge runtimes  
- ✅ Zero dependencies — pure ES module

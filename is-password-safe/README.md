**Lightweight, dependency-free password validator.**  
Password strength and safety validator.  
No catastrophic regex. Runs in O(n) time.

---

## üöÄ Why

Common password validators only check length or character mix.  
This module focuses on *actual security* ‚Äî entropy, structure, and predictability.  
`is-password-safe` rejects passwords that look random but follow obvious keyboard or  
dictionary patterns, while staying fast, dependency-free, and safe for browser use.

---

## üåü Features

- ‚úÖ Detects short, weak, or repetitive passwords  
- ‚úÖ Detects sequences like `abcd` or `1234`  
- ‚úÖ Flags dictionary-like passwords (`password123`, `qwerty`, etc.)  
- ‚úÖ Estimates entropy in bits  
- ‚úÖ Reports missing character sets (lower, upper, digit, symbol)  
- ‚úÖ No external dependencies  
- ‚úÖ Browser and Node compatible  

---

## üì¶ Usage

```js
import { validatePassword } from './is-password-safe/password.js';

const result = validatePassword('Aj4?mX9^kL3!yZ');

console.log(result);
/*
{
  ok: true,
  score: 3,
  entropyBits: 88,
  length: 14,
  sets: { lower: true, upper: true, digit: true, symbol: true },
  reasons: [],
  suggestions: []
}
*/
```

## üß© Validation rules

A password is considered **safe** (`ok: true`) only if:

- Its length ‚â• **12** characters (default)  
- Estimated entropy ‚â• **60 bits**  
- Contains at least one **lowercase**, **uppercase**, **digit**, and **symbol**  
- Does **not** contain dictionary words from the internal weak-word list  
- Does **not** include **sequential runs** like `abcd`, `1234`, or `qwerty`  
- Does **not** include **repeated blocks** like `abcabc` or `xxx`  
- Contains no catastrophic regex or unsafe characters (checked O(n))

Any failed rule adds a `reason` and suggested fix in the result.

## üß† API

**Options**
```ts
validatePassword(password: string, opts?: {
  minLength?: number;
  maxLength?: number;
  minEntropy?: number;
  requireSets?: Array<'lower'|'upper'|'digit'|'symbol'>;
  dictionaries?: string[];
}): {
  ok: boolean;
  score: 0|1|2|3|4;
  entropyBits: number;
  length: number;
  sets: { lower:boolean; upper:boolean; digit:boolean; symbol:boolean };
  reasons: string[];
  suggestions: string[];
}
```

**Scoring**
| Score | Meaning       |
|:------|:--------------|
| 0     | Very weak     |
| 1     | Weak          |
| 2     | Moderate      |
| 3     | Strong        |
| 4     | Very strong   |

## üß™ Example (`test.html`)

```html
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <body>
    <main>
      <input id="pw" type="password" placeholder="Type a password" />
      <button id="btn">Validate</button>
      <pre id="out">‚Ä¶</pre>
    </main>
    <script type="module">
      import { validatePassword } from './password.js';
      const $ = (id) => document.getElementById(id);
      $('btn').addEventListener('click', () => {
        const res = validatePassword($('pw').value);
        $('out').textContent = JSON.stringify(res, null, 2);
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## üß™ Browser test

Open `password-test.html` in your browser  
or try the hosted demo üëâüèª 
[Password Validator Test](https://yvancg.github.io/validators/is-password-safe/password-test.html)

---

## üõ† Development

This module is standalone. Copy `password.js` into your project.  
No `npm install` or build step required.

---

## üîí Notes

- Default minimum length: 12
- Default minimum entropy: 60 bits
- Extend dictionaries to block additional weak words.
- Use only local logic; no network calls by default.

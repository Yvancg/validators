# is-iban-safe

**Tiny, dependency-free IBAN validator and normalizer (ISO 13616 + ISO 7064).**  
Lightweight, auditable, and backed by the official SWIFT IBAN Registry.

---

## üöÄ Why
Most IBAN libraries depend on legacy regex sets or outdated country lists.  
`is-iban-valid` is a single-file validator that loads an up-to-date registry snapshot from SWIFT and verifies every rule natively ‚Äî checksum, country length, and BBAN structure.

---

## üì¶ Usage
```bash
import { isIbanSafe } from './is-iban-safe/iban.js';

isIbanSafe('DE44500105175407324931');
// ‚Üí { ok: true, normalized: 'DE44500105175407324931', issues: [] }

isIbanSafe('DE00500105175407324931');
// ‚Üí { ok: false, issues: ['checksum_failed'] }

isIbanSafe('IR062960000000100324200001', { blockCountries: ['IR'] });
// ‚Üí { ok: false, issues: ['country_blocked'] }
```

## üß© Validation rules
-	Country must exist in the SWIFT IBAN Registry
-	Total length matches registry entry
- Check digits pass ISO 7064 Mod-97 checksum
- Structure follows country-specific BBAN pattern
- Optional allowlist / blocklist filters by country code
- Optional strict casing (reject lowercase input)

## üõ† Development
This module is standalone. You can copy `iban.js` and `iban_registry_full.json` into your own project.  
No `npm install` or build step required.

To refresh the registry:
	1.	Download the latest SWIFT IBAN Registry from
https://www.swift.com/swift-resource/11971/download
	2.	Run the parser script to rebuild `iban_registry_full.json`
	3.	Verify all examples pass Mod-97 and length checks

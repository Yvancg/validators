**Tiny, dependency-free IBAN validator and normalizer (ISO 13616 + ISO 7064).**  
Lightweight, auditable, and backed by the official SWIFT IBAN Registry.

---

## 🚀 Why

Most IBAN libraries depend on legacy regex sets or outdated country lists.  
`is-iban-safe` is a single-file validator that loads an up-to-date registry snapshot from SWIFT and verifies every rule natively — checksum, country length, and BBAN structure.

---

## 📦 Usage

```js
import { isIbanSafe } from './is-iban-safe/iban.js';

isIbanSafe('DE44500105175407324931');
// → { ok: true, normalized: 'DE44500105175407324931', issues: [] }

isIbanSafe('DE00500105175407324931');
// → { ok: false, issues: ['checksum_failed'] }

isIbanSafe('IR062960000000100324200001', { blockCountries: ['IR'] });
// → { ok: false, issues: ['country_blocked'] }
```

---

## 🧩 Validation rules

- Country must exist in the SWIFT IBAN Registry  
- Total length matches registry entry  
- Check digits pass ISO 7064 Mod-97 checksum  
- Structure follows country-specific BBAN pattern  
- Optional allowlist / blocklist filters by country code  
- Optional strict casing (reject lowercase input)  

---

## 🧠 API

### `isIbanSafe(raw: string, options?: object): Promise<{ ok: boolean, normalized?: string, issues: string[] }>`

Validates an IBAN against the official SWIFT registry.

**Options**
- `allowCountries` – array of allowed ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes  
- `blockCountries` – array of blocked ISO country codes  
- `strictCase` – if `true`, rejects lowercase input  
- `strictStructure` – if `true`, enforces BBAN format from registry  
- `maxLength` / `minLength` – optional overrides for sanity checks  

**Returns**
A structured result:
```js
{
  ok: true,
  normalized: 'DE44500105175407324931',
  issues: []
}
```

## 🧪 Example (test.html)

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { isIbanSafe } from './iban.js';

      const ibans = [
        'DE44500105175407324931',
        'GB29NWBK60161331926819',
        'FR1420041010050500013M02606',
        'DE00500105175407324931',
        'IR062960000000100324200001'
      ];

      for (const iban of ibans) {
        const result = await isIbanSafe(iban, { strictStructure: true });
        console.log(iban, '→', result);
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## 🛠 Development

This module is standalone. You can copy `iban.js` and `iban_registry_full.json` into your own project.  
No `npm install` or build step required.

To refresh the registry:
1. Download the latest SWIFT IBAN Registry from  
   https://www.swift.com/swift-resource/11971/download
2. Run the parser script to rebuild `iban_registry_full.json`  
3. Verify all examples pass Mod-97 and length checks
